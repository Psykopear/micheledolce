### Ardila's axioms

I firmly believe in Federico Ardila's axioms (stated [here](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf)):

**Axiom 1** *Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries,*

**Axiom 2** *Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences*.

**Axiom 3** *Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs*.

**Axiom 4** *Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect*.
