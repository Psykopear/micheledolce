## Research

My research interests are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics and kinetic theory. Specifically, I am currently working on the dissipation enhancement generated by mixing to study quantitatively the following problems: long-time behavior of passive scalars, convergence to given equilibria in hydrodynamic stability problems or in kinetic theory in a weakly collisional regime. 

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~mdolce/2020_Dolce.pdf), whose title is "*Linear stability analysis of stationary Euler flows for passive scalars and inhomogeneous fluids*". 

Here is a list of my papers:
