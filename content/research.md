## Research

My research interests are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics,
for both compressible and incompressible fluids. I am currently working on hydrodynamic stability problems, such as understanding the dynamics of perturbations around a laminar equilibrium. 
The interest in addressing these questions dates back to the end of the XIXth century. However, a quantitative description of the dynamics can be challenging even in (apparently) simple scenarios. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in the precise quantification of phenomena as *inviscid damping* and *enhanced dissipation*, observed in the vicinity of a shear flow for instance. These mechanisms are intimately related to the mixing process generated by a background flow, which can also act as an external driving force for a passive tracer. 

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~mdolce/2020_Dolce.pdf), whose title is "*Linear stability analysis of stationary Euler flows for passive scalars and inhomogeneous fluids*". 

I give a more detailed explanation of my research in my [Research Statement](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~mdolce/research_statement_MD).
