## Research

My main research interests lie in the analysis of partial differential equation.  
In particular, are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics.

Most of my papers are [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-6254-2070.html).

Here are my [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/author.html?mrauthid=1400737), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0sJTT28AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele_Dolce) profiles.
