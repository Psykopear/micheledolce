My research interests are focused on problems related to fluid dynamics,
for both compressible and incompressible fluids.  
I am currently working on stability problems such as inviscid damping
and enhanced dissipation.

Here is a list of my papers:
1. M. Coti Zelati & M. Dolce, *Separation of time-scales in drift-diffusion equations on R2*, _Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées_ **142** (2020), 58-75. [arXiv:1907.04012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04012)
