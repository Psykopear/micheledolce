## Bio

I am an SNF Ambizione Fellow at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).

Until December 2024, I﻿ was a Postdoc in mathematics at the EPFL working in the group of Prof. Maria Colombo (AMCV lab). Until August 2022, I was a Research Associate in Mathematics at Imperial College London working in the group of Prof. Michele Coti Zelati.

I obtained a PhD degree from the Gran Sasso Science Institute, in November 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Michele Coti Zelati.
