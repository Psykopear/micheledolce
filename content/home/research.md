## N﻿ews

I﻿ have been awarded an SNSF Ambizione for my project "*Long-time behavior of PDEs in Fluid Dynamics and Kinetic Theories*".

I have been awarded the "*INdAM-UMI-SIMAI award 2023*" rewarding the authors of the best doctoral theses discussed in Italian universities on Mathematics topics in the period 2020-2023. See the announcement [here](https://www.altamatematica.it/blog/2023/11/16/premi-indam-simai-umi-2023/)

## Research

My main research interests lie in the analysis of partial differential equations. In particular, I am focusing on problems related to fluid dynamics and kinetic theory.\
See the [research section](/research/) on this website for more information.

Most of my papers are available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0002-6254-2070.html).

You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://iris.gssi.it/handle/20.500.12571/15111#.YAM8auj7RPY).
